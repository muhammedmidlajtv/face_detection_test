# FEATURES

## .  User-Friendly Interface
Bookish Umbrella provides users with a user-friendly interface, allowing them to register and log in to their individual accounts effortlessly. Once logged in, users can explore the vast collection of books available on the website, conveniently organized by genre, author, or other criteria. With the intuitive search functionality, users can quickly find the books they're looking for, whether by name or author.

## . Efficient Book Issuing System
Our system enables users to issue books with ease, with a maximum limit of up to five books per user for a period of seven days. This streamlined book issuing process ensures that users can enjoy their chosen reads without hassle.

## . Librarian Access and Management
Librarians can seamlessly manage the library's resources by logging in as Archivists. From monitoring the status of sections and books to editing, removing, or deleting sections and books from the website, Archivists have full control over the library's inventory. Additionally, Archivists can view which user has borrowed which book, facilitating efficient book tracking and management.

## . Intelligent Book Recommendations
One of the standout features of Bookish Umbrella is its ability to suggest books based on users' facial emotions. Leveraging advanced technology, our system analyzes users' facial expressions and recommends books that align with their mood and preferences, enhancing the overall reading experience.
